Twibblr
=======

A Rails Engine for adding blogging (and much more to come later, such as github commit history, tweets, flicer integration, etc) to an existing site. The aim is to have completely non-conflicting models, controllers, et cetera and to allow mounting the system anywhere (/posts, /subdir/posts, etc)

Install
=======

    script/plugin install git://github.com/bjeanes/twibblr.git
    # run rake twibblr:install if you don't see instructions
    rake db:migrate
